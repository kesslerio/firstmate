# tests/fm-session-lock-ps-denied.test.sh - the ps-free identity route.
#
# An EDR-style policy can deny the ps BINARY's exec (verified on a hardened
# macOS host: /bin/ps refused even `ps -V`, while kill/head/sysctl/pgrep/lsof
# ran), and before bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh could fall back to an OS
# provider, that turned every session into a permanent lock-refused
# read-only one, because identity proof walked ancestry through ps.
#
# The unit cases drive the library behind a deterministic fake ps that
# refuses to run (exit 126, bash's refused-exec status) plus a fake OS
# provider, covering the fallback decision table on any host. The e2e case
# blocks ps from a REAL process tree (fake ps on PATH) and resolves a real
# pid through the REAL platform provider, so a regression that only fakes
# would miss is caught here.
